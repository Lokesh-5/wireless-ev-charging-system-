A wireless electric vehicle (EV) charging system, also known as wireless charging or inductive charging, is a technology that enables the charging of electric vehicles without the need for a physical connection between the charging station and the vehicle. It offers a convenient and efficient method of charging EVs by eliminating the need to plug and unplug a charging cable.

Here's a description of how a wireless EV charging system typically works:

Charging Pad: The system consists of two main components: a charging pad installed on the ground or embedded in a parking surface and a receiving pad installed on the vehicle. The charging pad on the ground contains a set of coils that generate an alternating magnetic field.

Receiving Pad: The receiving pad, usually located on the underside of the EV, also contains a set of coils that are designed to resonate with the alternating magnetic field produced by the charging pad. This resonance creates an electromagnetic coupling between the two sets of coils.

Power Transfer: When the vehicle is parked over the charging pad, the alternating magnetic field induces an electric current in the receiving pad's coils through electromagnetic induction. This current is then converted into DC power by the vehicle's onboard charger, which charges the EV's battery.

Alignment and Efficiency: To ensure efficient power transfer, the vehicle's receiving pad and the charging pad must be properly aligned. This alignment can be achieved using visual or sensor-based systems to guide the driver during parking. Modern wireless charging systems are designed to tolerate slight misalignments and automatically adjust the charging parameters for optimal performance.

Charging Control: The charging system incorporates various safety and control features. Communication protocols between the charging pad and the vehicle allow for data exchange to verify the charging status, monitor battery health, and control the charging process. These protocols ensure safe and reliable charging operations.
